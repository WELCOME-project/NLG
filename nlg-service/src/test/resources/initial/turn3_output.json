  "text" : "Great! Karim, you need to register at the closest resident registration office using your current address in Terrassa. When you have an apartment on your own, you will need to update your registration.\nThe registration office is in the Raval de Montserrat, 14 street. The opening hours are from 9:00 to 15:00. You will need to bring with you your passport. Once you have registered, we will process your application.\nI can already give you some information on the First Reception Service. It consists of three modules: the language module, the labour market information module, and the Catalan society module. The language teaching module is a 90 hours course. At ColÂ·legi Sagrat Cor nearby a course is offered on Mondays and Fridays from 19:00 to 21:00. The labour and Catalan society courses take place here at the City Council on Wednesdays from 19:00 to 21:00.I can already give you some information...\nBye-bye. "
